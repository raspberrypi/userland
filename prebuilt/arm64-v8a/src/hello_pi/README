Building on Pi
++++++++++++++

To build the test apps on the pi, first build the libs:
make -C libs/ilclient
make -C libs/vgfont

then by entering each test app directory and run make. E.g.
  cd hello_world
  make
  ./hello_world.bin

Running ./rebuild.sh will rebuild the all libs and and apps.


Building on a different PC
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to build the samples on a different machine (cross-compile) then set:
SDKSTAGE=<path/to/firmware-directory> and CC=<path/to/cross-compiler>
before running make.
