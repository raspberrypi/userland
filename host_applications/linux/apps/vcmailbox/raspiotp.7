.SH NAME
raspiotp \- the Raspberry Pi OTP register bits
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
All SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi range have a inbuilt One-Time Programmable
(OTP) memory block. 
It is 66 32-bit values long, although only a few locations have
factory-programmed data.
The
.BR vcgencmd (1)
utility can be used to display the contents of the OTP like so:
.PP
.EX
$ \fBvcgencmd otp_dump\fR
.EE
.
.

.SH INDUSTRIAL USE
The Raspberry Pi is often used as part of another product. This section
describes some extra facilities available to use other capabilities of the Pi.
.
.SS Customer OTP settings
There are a number of OTP values that can be used. To see a list of all the OTP
values, you can use:
.PP
.EX
$ \fBvcgencmd otp_dump\fR
.EE
.PP
In register locations 36 to 43 (inclusive), there are eight rows of 32 bits
available for the customer (detailed in
.B OTP REGISTERS
above).
.PP
To program these bits, you will need to use the vcmailbox. This is a Linux
driver interface to the firmware which will handle the programming of the rows.
To do this, please refer to the documentation at [MAILBOX], and the
.BR vcmailbox (1)
example application. For example:
.PP
.EX
$ \fBvcmailbox 0x00010004 8 8 0 0\fR
0x00000020 0x80000000 0x00010004 0x00000008 0x800000008 0xnnnnnnnn
0x00000000 0x00000000
.EE
.PP
The above uses the
.B GET_BOARD_SERIAL
tag (detailed under [MAILBOX]) with a request size of 8 bytes and response
size of 8 bytes (sending two integers for the request 0, 0). The response to
this will be two integers (0x00000020 and 0x80000000) followed by the tag code,
the request length, the response length (with the 31st bit set to indicate that
it is a response) then the 64 bit serial number (where the MS 32bits are always
0).
.PP
To set the customer OTP values you will need to use the
.B SET_CUSTOMER_OTP
(0x38021) tag as follows:
.PP
.EX
$ \fBvcmailbox 0x00038021 \fI[8+rows*4] [8+rows*4] [start] [rows] [value]\fR ...
.EE
.TP
.B start
the first row to program from 0-7
.TP
.B rows
number of rows to program
.TP
.B value
each value to program
.PP
So, to program OTP customer rows 4, 5, and 6 to 0x11111111, 0x22222222,
0x33333333 respectively, you would use:
.PP
.EX
$ \fBvcmailbox 0x00038021 20 20 4 3 0x11111111 0x22222222 0x33333333\fR
.EE
.PP
This will then program rows 40, 41, and 42. To read the values back, you can
use:
.PP
.EX
$ \fBvcmailbox 0x00030021 20 20 4 3 0 0 0\fR
0x0000002c 0x80000000 0x00030021 0x00000014 0x80000014 0x00000000
0x00000003 0x11111111 0x22222222 0x33333333
.EE
.PP
If you'd like to integrate this functionality into your own code, you should be
able to achieve this by using the vcmailbox.c code as an example.
.
.SS Locking the OTP changes
It is possible to lock the OTP changes to avoid them being edited again. This
can be done using a special argument with the OTP write mailbox:
.PP
.EX
$ \fBvcmailbox 0x00038021 8 8 0xffffffff 0xaffe0000\fR
.EE
.PP
Once locked, the customer OTP values can no longer be altered. Note that this
locking operation is irreversible.
.
.SS Making customer OTP bits unreadable
It is possible to prevent the customer OTP bits from being read at all. This
can be done using a special argument with the OTP write mailbox:
.PP
.EX
$ \fBvcmailbox 0x00038021 8 8 0xffffffff 0xaffebabe\fR
.EE
.PP
This operation is unlikely to be useful for the vast majority of users, and is
irreversible.
